Hi, my name is God and I can see you readyng this right now. You are smilling but think that I am an idiot too. Now you are surprised that I can read your mind. You also think that I am silly and not God because I misspelled "reading". Not just that, but my grammar is bad as well. Which I know you noticed because I AM GOD.
